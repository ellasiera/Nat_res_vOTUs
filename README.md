Soil vOTUs from 5 sites in California

Here you will find the viral representative draft genomes (vOTUs) from a study titled "Substantial differences in soil viral community composition within and among four Northern California habitats".

Due to the amount of vOTUs (3432 in total), the fasta file containing them was broken into 4 files named drep_vibrant_natres_1.fa, drep_vibrant_natres_2.fa, drep_vibrant_natres_3.fa, and drep_vibrant_natres_4.fa

The vOTUs were enerated by identifying viral contigs in metagenomes with VIBRANT (Kieft et al.), and clustering them with cd-hit-est at 95% identity and 85% coverage of the shortest contig. The longest contig of each cluster was chosen to represent that cluster.

Bioinformatic analyses scripts and ata files can be found in the Analysis folder.
